          <h1>Academic Projects</h1>
          <p>
            During my studies at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, I have worked
            on a variety of academic projects that explore the intersection of
            technology and design. This page is a showcase of some of the most
            notable projects I have completed so far. And is continuously
            updated during my study.

          <h2>Module 1</h2>
          <p>
            During the first module of my Creative Technology degree, I was
            introduced to the core disciplines and mindset of becoming a
            creative technologist. This module laid the foundation for my
            studies and helped me develop a strong understanding of the
            principles of design, technology, and innovation.

          <h2>Poster Design</h2>
          <p>
            For a Visual Communication module focusing on "design for behavioral
            change," I was tasked with creating a poster that uses core design
            principles to convey a complex message clearly. I chose to address
            Phishing, aiming to create a visual cue that stops users before they
            fall victim to digital scams.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Design Solution Using Adobe InDesign, I developed a strong
            visual metaphor, the fish hook to immediately communicate the danger
            of being deceived.
          </p>
          <p>
            I utilized a combination of bold contrast, clear hierarchy and

          <h2>Behavior Change Video</h2>
          <p>
            During a one-week intensive hackathon, we were asked to design a
            social marketing video aimed at influencing behavior. The goal was
            to combine storytelling, visual communication, and behavioral
            psychology to address a specific issue relevant to our peers.

          <p>
            My team chose to tackle the reliance on ChatGPT in academic studies.
            Instead of a standard warning, we used humor to illustrate the
            long-term dangers of AI usage. The video shows professionals such as
            an electrician, a surgeon, and a bomb squad technician failing
            because they relied on AI rather than their own knowledge.

          <h2>Sense-Process-Act</h2>
          <p>
            My team and I designed and build a tangible prototype using the
            sense process act concept. We used the NE555 timer for this as the
            processing unit.
          </p>
          <p>
            We developed an autonomous vehicle that follows a line on the
            ground. The car uses light sensors (sense) to detect the line and
            adjust its steering accordingly (act), using the NE555 processing
            unit. This technology was cased in a laser cut wooden car.
          </p>
          <p>
            While the prototype encountered functional limitations during the
            final demonstration, the project was a valuable exercise in analog
            circuit design, hardware troubleshooting, and rapid prototyping
            under strict deadlines.

          <h2>Smart Relaxation Room</h2>
          <p>
            For a smart environments project, we designed an interactive room
            that adapts to users' relaxation needs. The room uses sensors to
            monitor environmental factors like heartrate, external noise and
            temperature, adjusting them accordingly to create an optimal
            relaxation experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            The room features adjustable lighting, soundscapes, and climate
            control, all orchestrated through a central system that responds to
            real-time data. This project highlights the potential of technology
            to enhance well-being through personalized environments.
